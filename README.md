## Data Analysis
The data analysis is performed using Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step analysis of the dataset, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. The analysis is documented in the notebook with explanations and comments to make it easily understandable.

## Insights and Findings
Based on the data analysis, the following insights and findings were obtained:

- The highest contributing factor to higher profits was found to be the increase in revenue, especially from the sales of Product A and Product B.
- Expenses, particularly marketing and advertising expenses, were found to have a negative impact on profits. Lowering these expenses can help increase profits.
- Seasonality was observed in the dataset, with higher profits during the holiday season and lower profits during the off-season.
- Profit margins were found to be higher for online sales compared to in-store sales, indicating that focusing on online sales channels may lead to higher profits.
- Further analysis using regression and correlation techniques showed a strong positive correlation between revenue and profit, indicating that revenue growth is a key driver for higher profits.
